/**
  * A `Task` based asynchronous channel for reading, writing, and manipulating a TCP socket.
  *
  * On the JVM this is a wrapper around
  * [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/channels/AsynchronousSocketChannel.html java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel]]
  * (class available since Java 7 for doing async I/O on sockets).
  *
  * @example {{{
  *   val taskSocketChannel = TaskSocketChannel()
  *   val writeT =
  *     for {
  *       _ <- taskSocketChannel.connect(new InetSocketAddress("google.com", 80))
  *       written <- taskSocketChannel.write(ByteBuffer.wrap("Hello world!".getBytes("UTF-8")), None)
  *     } yield {
  *       written
  *     }
  *
  *   writeT.runAsync(new Callback[Int] {
  *     override def onSuccess(value: Int): Unit = println(f"Bytes written: $value%d")
  *     override def onError(ex: Throwable): Unit = println(s"ERR: $ex")
  *   })
  * }}}
  * @define asyncSocketChannelDesc The underlying [[monix.nio.tcp.AsyncSocketChannel AsyncSocketChannel]]
  * @define connectDesc Connects this channel.
  * @define remoteDesc the remote address to which this channel is to be connected
  * @define localAddressDesc Asks the socket address that this channel's socket is bound to
  * @define remoteAddressDesc Asks the remote address to which this channel's socket is connected
  * @define readDesc Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer
  * @define readDestDesc is the buffer holding the bytes read on completion
  * @define readReturnDesc the number of bytes read or -1 if no bytes could be read
  *         because the channel has reached end-of-stream
  * @define writeDesc Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer
  * @define writeSrcDesc is the buffer holding the sequence of bytes to write
  * @define writeReturnDesc the number of bytes that were written
  * @define timeout an optional maximum time for the I/O operation to complete
  * @define stopReadingDesc Indicates that this channel will not read more data
  *         - end-of-stream indication
  * @define stopWritingDesc Indicates that this channel will not write more data
  *         - end-of-stream indication
  * @define closeDesc Closes this channel
